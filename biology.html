    Carbon Neutrality - What Does It Mean And Why Are Companies <br><br><br><br><br> 
    Striving To Acheive It? - Max A

  <div class="Main">
    <h3>What is Carbon Neutrality?</h3>
    <p style="line-height: 20px;">
      <span style="color:#426cf5">Carbon neutrality</span>
      is defined as having net zero emissions, or matching your carbon emissions with systems that can absorb carbon. 
      There are multiple procedures to acheive this goal. <span style="color:#426cf5">Carbon sink</span> is a strategy 
      to replace emissions by reintroducing natural elements that absorb carbon back into the environment. This cannot 
      be done artificially as there is not a system or technology yet capable of such a feat.
      <span style="color:#426cf5">Carbon offset</span> is a strategy to reduce emissions so carbon sinking can be less 
      of a task. This could be completed by removing energy sources that come from coal, and replacing them with renewable 
      energy sources such as wind or solar technology.
    </p>
    <h3>Why Do Companies Strive To Be Carbon Neutral?</h3>
    <p style="line-height: 20px;">
      Many companies across the globe, especiall mass-market companies, are continually getting closer to the goal of 
      complete carbon nautrality, but why? Well, the encompassing reason is revenue, but there are many areas in which 
      revenue could be affected. There are four main reasons for companies' change of hearts: 
      <span style="color:#426cf5">Increased revenue</span>,  
      <span style="color:#426cf5">reduced cost</span>, 
      <span style="color:#426cf5">persuading stakeholders</span>, and 
      <span style="color:#426cf5">and mitigating risk</span>. 
      An increase in revenue is due to companies being able to market as a sustainable company, which many perceive as
      a honorable status. Reduction in cost is due to the reduction or negation of fossil-fuel reliance, which has been
      increaseing in price substantially over recent years. From the EIA website it states that average gas prices of the 
      "regular" quality have increased from $1.84 per gallon in April of 2020 to $4.44 per gallon in May of 2022. 
      Furthermore, the change can persuade stakeholders in beleiveing that their company is progressive in change, whether
      to law or to economic variation. Carbon nautrality also mitigates risk, as they don't have to rely on the crashing 
      fossil-fuel economy (as previously exemplified), and also dodges the variety of newly instantiated government 
      sanctions, tariffs, and other laws that either prohibit or heavily discurage fossil-fuel use (through economic persuasion).
    </p>
    <h3>What To Take Away</h3>
    <p style="line-height: 20px;">
      Companies are using a variety of strategies, from natural carbon removal in a process called carbon sink, to carbon offset,
      the more popular solution. Though it is great that companies are beginning to mitigate their carbon emissions, it is
      important to realize that companies are not doing this as a selfless act, and instead as a marketing strategy. I 
      personally view this dillema as a double-edged sword. You'd want to support a companies decision to mitigate climate
      change, but at the same time you'd also be increasing a corperation's or megacorperation's profits. However, you could 
      always donate to a non-profit organization such as <a href="https://teamtrees.org/" target="_blank">teamtrees.org</a> to
      contribute to repairing the Earth's ecosystems.
